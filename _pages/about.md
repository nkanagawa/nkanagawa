In 2006, I graduated from [Yale University](https://history.yale.edu/) with a B.A. in history and traveled to Yokohama, Japan on a Richard U. Light fellowship to join the [Inter University Center](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/IUC/cgi-bin/) for Japanese for Japanese Language Studies’ 10-month program. After completing the IUC program, I joined Google's Tokyo office and spent three years working in a variety of roles (recruiter, executive assistant, internal communications) before returning to the U.S. and to academia. I received my MA in 2013 and my PhD in 2019 from the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/hist/), where I specialized in premodern Japanese history. During that time, I was awarded a Japan Foundation dissertation fellowship (2014-2015) and spent a year as a researcher at the  [Historiographical Institute at The University of Tokyo (史料編纂所) ](https://www.hi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/). I am currently James B. Duke Assistant Professor of Asian Studies and History at [Furman University](https://www.furman.edu/academics/asian-studies/) in Greenville, SC. My primary research interests lie in the fields of classical Japanese and East Asian legal and cultural history.
