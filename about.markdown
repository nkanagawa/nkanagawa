My primary research interests lie in the fields of classical Japanese and East Asian legal and cultural history. As an assistant professor in Asian Studies and History at Furman University I teach courses including Ancient to Early Japan, Modern Japan, Introduction to Asian Studies, and Samurai: Real and Imagined (a freshman writing seminar).
